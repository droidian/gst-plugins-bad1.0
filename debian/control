Description: GStreamer helper programs from the "bad" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains helper programs from the "bad" set, a set of
 plug-ins that aren't up to par compared to the rest. They might be
 close to being good quality, but they're missing something - be it a
 good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live
 maintainer, or some actual wide use.
